TODO
====
- [ ] Move `stores/accountContext.js` to `Account.svelte` and allow children to access via the Context API.
- [ ] Add scroll listeners to `AccountMain.svelte` that will update `mainScreen`
- [ ] The REST (css preprocess, finish implementing the rest of the screens, hook up stores from the rest of the app, create components that I have been putting off (i.e. one to disable vidy currency in the same format that is used throughout), etc)
